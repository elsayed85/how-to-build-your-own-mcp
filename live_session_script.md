# üé¨ YouTube Live Session Script: MCP Mastery

## üéØ Opening Hook (2 minutes)

**"Hey everyone! Welcome to this live coding session where we'll build Model Context Protocol servers from scratch. I'm going to show you something incredible - watch this!"**

*[Switch to VSCode]*

**"I'm going to ask GitHub Copilot to calculate 25 + 17 for me..."**

*[Type in chat: "What's 25 + 17?"]*

**"Look at that! It gave me 42 instantly. But here's the magic - it's not just doing math in its head. It's actually calling a custom MCP server that I built! Let me show you exactly how this works and how you can build your own."**

---

## üìö MCP Fundamentals (5 minutes)

**"First, let's understand what MCP actually is..."**

### What is MCP?
- **"MCP stands for Model Context Protocol - think of it as a bridge that lets AI models talk to external tools"**
- **"Instead of the AI guessing or hallucinating, it can actually USE real tools"**
- **"Like giving the AI hands to interact with the real world"**

### Core Components
- **"Three main parts: Client (the AI), Server (your tools), and Transport (how they talk)"**
- **"The AI sends requests, your server does the work, sends back results"**

### Why This Matters
- **"Real-time data access, accurate calculations, API integrations - no more hallucinations!"**

## ‚ö° Demo 1: Ultra Minimal Server (8 minutes)

**"Let's start with the absolute simplest MCP server possible..."**

### Show the Code
```bash
# Navigate and show ultra minimal server
cd stdio_mcp_server
cat ultra_minimal_server.py
```

**"Look at this - just 20 lines of code! This creates a complete MCP server with one tool: sum_two_numbers"**

### Key Points to Highlight:
- **"Import the MCP library"**
- **"Create a server with stdio transport"**
- **"Define one simple tool that adds two numbers"**
- **"That's it! This is a complete MCP server"**

### Run the Server
```bash
python ultra_minimal_server.py
```

**"Now it's running and waiting for connections. Let's test it!"**

### Test with Custom Client
```bash
# In new terminal
cd ../mcp_client
python client.py
```

**"Our custom client connects and we can see the communication happening in real-time!"**

---

## üîß Demo 2: Debugging & Development Tools (5 minutes)

**"Development without debugging is like flying blind. Let me show you the tools..."**

### Show Payload Monitoring
```bash
python watch_payloads.py
```

**"This tool captures every message between client and server - essential for debugging!"**

### Key Debugging Points:
- **"See the JSON-RPC messages"**
- **"Watch tool calls in real-time"**
- **"Understand the protocol flow"**

---

## üßÆ Demo 3: Advanced Calculator Server (10 minutes)

**"Now let's build something more sophisticated..."**

### Show Enhanced Code
```bash
cd ../stdio_mcp_server
cat calculator_mcp_server.py
```

**"This has multiple operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide - all with proper error handling"**

### Key Improvements:
- **"Multiple tools in one server"**
- **"Input validation and error handling"**
- **"Better response formatting"**

### Connect to VSCode
**"Now here's where it gets exciting - let's connect this to GitHub Copilot!"**

*[Show VSCode MCP configuration]*
*[Demonstrate asking Copilot to do calculations]*

**"See how it's actually calling our server? Real tool usage, not hallucination!"**

---

## üé® Demo 4: Image Generator Server (8 minutes)

**"Let's build something more creative - an image generator!"**

### Show the Implementation
```bash
cat image_generator_mcp_server.py
```

**"This generates random image URLs with customizable dimensions and effects"**

### Live Demo
**"Let me ask Copilot to generate some images for me..."**

*[Demo in VSCode: "Generate a 400x300 random image with blur effect"]*

**"Look! It's calling our server and returning actual image URLs!"**

---

## üìù Demo 5: Real-World API Integration (12 minutes)

**"Now for something really practical - managing dev.to blog posts!"**

### Show Blog Server
```bash
cat dev_blog_mcp_server.py
```

**"This connects to dev.to API - search articles, create posts, manage content"**

### Key Features:
- **"Real API authentication"**
- **"CRUD operations"**
- **"Error handling for external services"**

### Live Demo
**"Let me search for articles about Python..."**

*[Demo: Ask Copilot to search for Python articles on dev.to]*

**"It's actually hitting the real dev.to API and returning live data!"**

---

## üê≥ Demo 6: Docker Containerization (6 minutes)

**"For production, we need containerization. Let me show you..."**

### Show Dockerfile
```bash
cat calculatorMcp.Dockerfile
```

**"Simple Python container with our MCP server"**

### Build and Run
```bash
docker build -f calculatorMcp.Dockerfile -t calculator-mcp .
docker run calculator-mcp
```

**"Now our MCP server runs in a container - perfect for deployment!"**

---

## üåê Demo 7: HTTP/SSE Transport (8 minutes)

**"MCP isn't just stdio - let's see HTTP transport with Server-Sent Events..."**

### Show SSE Server
```bash
cd ../sse_server
cat main.py
```

**"FastAPI server with SSE transport - web-based MCP!"**

### Run the Server
```bash
python main.py
```

**"Now we have a web server that speaks MCP protocol!"**

---

## üïµÔ∏è Demo 8: Protocol Deep Dive (10 minutes)

**"Want to see what's really happening under the hood? Let's intercept the traffic!"**

### Show mitmproxy Setup
**"I'm going to intercept VSCode Copilot's actual requests..."**

*[Show mitmproxy capturing traffic]*

**"Look at these JSON-RPC messages! This is exactly what VSCode sends to our servers"**

### Custom Client Analysis
```bash
cd ../mcp_client
python client.py --verbose
```

**"Our custom client shows us the raw protocol messages"**

---
